## Language used C++

## About code:
### The code upon execution will ask the following input to perform tasks on the node:
#### 1 : Add Node to genesis node or down the line if not possible for genesis node
#### 2 : Merge Two Nodes by giving info.
#### 3 : Encryption/Decryption
#### 4 : Add Node to certain Node by providing address of it.
#### 5 : Find longest chain of genesis node.
#### 6 : Find longest chain of Node by providing address of it.
#### 7 : Exit

## Steps for compilation
### Linux terminal type
### g++ -o app.out app.cpp
### ./app.out


## Library used:
<bits/stdc++.h> in C++
It is basically a header file that includes every standard library. In programming contests, using this file is a good idea, when you want to reduce the time wasted in doing chores; especially when your rank is time sensitive.
In programming contests, people do focus more on finding algorithm to solve a problem than on software engineering. From, software engineering perspective, it is a good idea to minimize the include. If you use it actually includes a lot of files, which your program may not need, thus increases both compile time and program size unnecessarily.
